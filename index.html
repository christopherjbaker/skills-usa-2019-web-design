          <p>Hello, Nevada web design students and advisors. I want to start by saying that my main objective as Contest Chair is to find the team that can bring national gold back to Nevada. Please be sure to review the latest Skills USA Web Design Technical Standards.</p>
          <p>I would also like to thank the advisors who have provided feedback, concerns, and recommendations on contest operations, this input is critical to the continuous improvement of the contest. If you have further comments or suggestions, please be sure to let me know.</p>

          <h3>Contest Orientation</h3>
          <p>This contest will be conducted on Thursday. Contestants will arrive at orientation prepared to listen and ask questions.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <strong>Do not be late and do not expect mercy if you are.</strong><br />
            This applies to the orientation and especially to your pitch.

        <article id="prompt">
          <h2 class="major">Prompt and Work</h2>
          <p>You will be provided the prompt as the last task of the orientation, in both verbal and printed form. It will be a fairly open-ended prompt, explained from the point of view of a company hiring you.</p>
          <p>You will have wifi available, and you may use any publicly available references you wish. This is one way this contest will differ from the official standards. You may also use third party library (including but certainly not limited to React, jQuery, Font Awesome, etc). You may not use libraries which provide UI design or functionality (including but not limited to Material Design, Semantic UI, etc). If you choose to use libraries which contain both of these (such as Bootstrap), be sure you do not use any UI design or functionality. All design and code logic must be your own. If you have any questions about allowable libraries or resources, please ask.</p>

          <h3>Submission of Deliverables</h3>
          <p>At the close of the work period, you will be expected to provide your final deliverables via USB drive or email by the time stated in the schedule. Late submissions will not be accepted.</p>

          <h3>Sample Prompts</h3>
          <p>I will have a few sample prompts posted here by April 1st. Please check back then.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="judging">
          <h2 class="major">Judging</h2>

          <ul class="alt">
            <li>There will be two sets of judges. The first set will be present during the judging phase and primarily focusing on your pitch. They will be representing the client.</li>
            <li>The second set of judges will be off-site. These are industry professionals who will each be evaluating various aspects of your final deliverables.</li>
            <li>Your final score will be a combination of all of these scores.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Pitch</h3>
          <p>Once you have completed your project, this is your opportunity to sell your project. The judging panel will be functioning as your client, and you must convince them that your project is the best. You should treat them as you would treat a potential client.</p>
          <p>You will have time for a 5-minute presentation, and there will be 5 minutes of questions and answers from the judges. Time is extremely tight in order to accommodate all contestants, so you will be cut off if you go over your time. However, failure to utilize your full time will result in penalties. however.</p>

          <h3>Rubric</h3>
          <p>I will have the preliminary rubrics posted here by March 25th. Please check back then.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="notes">
          <h2 class="major">Notes</h2>

          <h3>Resumes</h3>
          <p>Resumes will be collected at the close of orientation. Every member of your team will provide a complete and fully developed resume at the contest orientation. If any single resume is missing or is of substantially poor quality, 10 points will be deducted from the teamâ€™s score. Work with your team to make sure you all have professional resumes printed and ready. Do not expect mercy if you forget.</p>

          <h3>Clothing</h3>
          <p>This is one area that I am deviating from the official standards. Strict dress code will not be enforced during orientation or work time; please dress appropriately. For the pitch, dress to impress; you will be judged accordingly. Do not feel confined by the official clothing requirements.</p>

          <h3>Contestant Conduct</h3>
          <p>During the entire conference all contestants will conduct themselves in a manner that represents:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Skills USA Web Design Technical Standards</li>
            <li>The NV Skills USA Code of Conduct</li>
            <li>Industry professionals</li>
            <li>Fair and friendly competition</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Additionally:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Any interaction between a contestant and a non-contestant in the contest area without the Contest Chair's prior approval is grounds for immediate disqualification.</li>
            <li>Help every other member of your team prepare by sharing and peer reviewing resumes.</li>
            <li>Help every other member of your team prepare by checking that everyone understands the dress code
            <li>Support your teammates. Teams that bicker rarely win. Teams that collaborate are better at solving problems and produce a better result.</li>
            <li>Meet new people and develop relationships with other competitors; they are your peers in the industry and good friends to have. This is a four-day event, friends in the industry are worth far more than any medal.</li>
            <li>Be sure to review and understand the Skills USA grievance process. Grievances should not be directed to the contest chair.</li>
          </ul>
