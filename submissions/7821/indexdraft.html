				<center><h3>The Story of Kingston and Rosina</h3></center>
				<center><p style = "font-size: 17.5px;">Kingston Mendez and Rosina Parkinson first met at Jameson
				High School in Sacramento in 2012 as Seniors. When they graduated, they were
				thousands of miles apart from each other, not knowing whether they would
				see each other again.</p>
				<p style = "font-size: 17.5px;">Kingston graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering. He was hired by a fuel company in Irvine that specializes in aviation fuel. His revolutionary work in the company impressed the CEO and he was made lead engineer for all the plants the company has all over the United States. The National Board of Chemical Engineers was also impressed by his work that they decided to place him as the newest member of the board. Many resporters heard of this and asked for interviews. One interview in particular was the moment when he fell for the particular journalist.</p>
				<p style = "font-size: 17.5px;">Rosina graduated from Hampton University with a Bachelor's Degree in Journalism. She moved to Irvine hoping to find an opportunity for a career. She was accepted into the Irvine Gazette and was immediately placed as Chief Reporter. Word spread of the Chemical Engineer in Irvine that was invited to the National Board of Chemical Engineers as its newest member. She immediately knew who he was and was assigned to interview the person.</p>
				<p style = "font-size: 17.5px;">After the interview, Kingston asked her on a date. They started dating in late 2017 and in January 2019, Kingston proposed to Rosina and are now officially engaged.</p></center>
